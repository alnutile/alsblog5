Feature: Products Page needs to work
  Needs to do what it does now
  As an anonymous user
  So I know this upgrade worked :)


  Scenario: On the products page
    Given I am on products page
    Then it should have the ReadOrListen.com
    And it should show statuschecker class
    And it should have the needed menu area
    Then the footer should have my contact info and working links
