Feature: Blog Page needs to work
  Needs to do what it does now
  As an anonymous user
  So I know this upgrade worked :)


  Scenario: On the blog page
    Given I am on the page with posts
    Then I should have the top banner and projects under it
    And it should have the needed menu area
    And it should have tags
    And it should have a quote as well as a photo of me
    Then the footer should have my contact info and working links
